          “For some reason, as a society we sanctify “youth”.
          You may say that this project for me is an attempt
          to do the same. Each one of my heroines is for me, 
          a goddess each one of their gestures is sanctified.

        For me, these photos are not about eroticism for
        eroticism’s sake, or even about eroticism at all. 
        Rather “Girls” is about being able to catch and
        reexamine that transient, waifish, liminal moment 
        between “almost childhood” and “almost adulthood” 
        that I have already passed in my own life.

        These themes are very present in my previous work
        as well, the conflict between “power” and “weakness”
        “sensuality” and “aggression”. All this converged in 
        the images of my “Girls” who are always full of
        contradictions. The beauty and the essence  of 
        “waifishness” or “girlhood” for me,
        is in its transience…”
